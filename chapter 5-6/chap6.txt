	In the this chapter, I focused on enhancing the app's functionality by implementing features that improve user interaction and task management. One key addition was the "Add" button, which enables users to seamlessly create and add new tasks to their to-do lists. This feature was carefully designed to ensure ease of use, allowing users to quickly input tasks while maintaining an organized and efficient workflow. By incorporating this functionality, the app takes a significant step toward becoming a practical tool for managing daily tasks effectively.
