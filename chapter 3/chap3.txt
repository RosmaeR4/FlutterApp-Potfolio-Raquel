What I learned from this chapter:	

	From studying Dart, I learned that it is a versatile programming language often used for building mobile, web, and desktop applications, particularly with Flutter. I gained knowledge about commenting code to enhance readability and using the top-level main() function as the entry point of any Dart application. I explored how to declare and reference various data types, including numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, maps, and runes. I also understood the usage of flow control statements like if, for, while, the ternary operator, and switch-case for decision-making and looping. Functions were highlighted as a powerful way to group reusable logic for better code organization. Additionally, I learned to import external packages, libraries, or classes using the import statement, enabling modular development. Lastly, I discovered how to create classes to encapsulate data and methods, which supports object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation and abstraction.
