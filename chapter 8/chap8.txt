	In this chapter, I added a dedicated page that allows users to view their completed tasks, providing a clear and organized way to track their progress. This feature enhances the app's functionality by giving users a sense of accomplishment as they review the tasks they have successfully completed. To access this page, users can simply click on the check icon located at the top-right corner of the app bar. The check icon, enclosed within a transparent circle with a white border, is prominently displayed for easy navigation. This addition not only enriches the user experience but also reinforces the app's goal of promoting productivity and task management.
