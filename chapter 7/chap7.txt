	In this chapter, I introduced the delete functionality to enhance task management within the app, providing users with an intuitive way to remove tasks from their to-do list. By implementing a swipe gesture, users can slide a task to the left to reveal the delete button, making the process quick and efficient. This design ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience, allowing users to maintain a clutter-free task list effortlessly. Adding this feature not only improves the app's usability but also aligns with modern app design standards by incorporating gesture-based interactions.
